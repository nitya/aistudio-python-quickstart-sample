# 02 | Core Concepts

In this section, we'll cover the core concepts and technologies we will reference in the quickstart tutorial. This is not a comprehensive introduction to Azure AI Studio or Generative AI applications. Check out the []


Before we dive into the development process, let's review a few core terms and concepts that you will encounter in this tutorial. 

If you're already familiar with Azure AI Studio preview and related Azure AI services and tools, skip ahead to üëâüèΩ [**Step 01**: Setup Dev Environment](./01-start.md)


### 1. What is Azure AI Studio?

[Azure AI Studio](https://aka.ms/azureaistudio) is a trusted platform that provides a simplfied developer experience for exploring, building, testing and deploying AI solutions that are also grounded in responsible AI practices. 
 - Manage your Azure AI project directly from the **Azure AI Studio UI**
 - Interact with the project programmatically, using the **Azure AI SDK**
 - Interact with the project from the commandline, using the **Azure AI CLI**

With the Azure AI Studio, you get a centralized space for exploring and deploying AI models, discovering AI services, and managing your AI project resources for the end-to-end development experience.


### 2. What is a copilot?

A copilot is an application that uses modern AI and large language models (LLM) to assist you in completing complex cognitive tasks. 

In this particular tutorial, we are building a copilot that assists you in answering user questions _about your company data_, by using the [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/retrieval-augmented-generation) pattern  with your preferred LLM deployment endpoint.

### 3. What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?

[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview) is a pattern where you _augment_ the capability of the default Large Language Model (LLM) by adding an _information retrieval system_. This provides you more control over the data used by the LLM in generating responses to user "questions", allowing you to tailor copilot responses to reflect your company data and requirements.

![How does RAG Work?](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/media/index-retrieve/rag-pattern.png)

The RAG pattern (shown above) maintains a data store with your custom data. When the copilot receives a user question, it retrieves data matching the question from this store. It then combines the user question with retrieved data to form the prompt sent to the LLM, helping ground the returned responses.

![What is an Index and why do I need it?](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/media/index-retrieve/rag-pattern-with-index.png)

Searching and retrieving data quickly and accurately is critical. The RAG pattern achieves this by proactively maintaining _search indexes_ (as shown above) to improve performance and accuracy.

Azure AI provides an Index asset to use with RAG - where the asset knows where the index is stored, how to access it, what search modes it supports, whether it has vector search capability, what embedding model it uses for this, and more. Currently, Azure AI Search is the primary Index solution for Azure AI projects. | See: [Retrieval Augmented Generation and Indexes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/retrieval-augmented-generation#how-does-rag-work)


### What is Azure AI Search? 

[Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) (formerly called _Azure Cognitive Search_) provides tools, APIs and infrastructure to **support information retrieval at scale** over heterogeneous data sources - for traditional and conversational search solutions. It is a [proven solution for information retrieval in RAG architectures](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) and can be accessed from Azure AI Studio, Azure AI SDK or Azure AI CLI.

### What is Vector Search in Azure AI Search?

Vector search is an information retrieval approach using numeric representations of content for search scenarios. The search engine now matches on vectors that are the most similar to the query, without needing to match exact terms. This helps it power similarity search, multi-modal search, recommendations engines, or apps implementing the 
[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview) architecture.

Vector search is available in Azure AI Search by default, and works as shown in the figure below. In this project, we use Azure AI Search to create a vector store for the product information data, then use Azure Open AI `text-embedding-ada-002` deployment for embedding data in vectors, for more efficient search and retrieval later. | See [Vector search in Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-overview) for more details.
